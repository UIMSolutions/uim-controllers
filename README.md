In the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, the **controller** plays a crucial role as the intermediary between the **model** and the **view**.

**Definition**:

- The **controller** is a component that manages the flow of data and interactions within an MVC-based application.
- It receives input from the user (such as button clicks or form submissions) and decides how to handle it.

**Key Responsibilities**:

- **User Input Handling**:
  - The controller listens for events triggered by the **view** (or other external sources).
  - When an event occurs (e.g., a button click), the controller reacts accordingly.
- **Communication with the Model**:
  - The controller interacts with the **model** to retrieve or update data.
  - It calls methods on the model to perform necessary operations.
- **Updating the View**:
  - After processing user input or model updates, the controller ensures that the **view** reflects the current state of the data.
  - It updates the view by modifying the display elements (such as updating labels, lists, or images).

**Example**:

- Consider a simple web application that displays a list of tasks (the model) and allows users to mark tasks as completed (the view).
- The controller handles user clicks on task checkboxes:
  - It updates the model to mark the task as completed.
  - It notifies the view to refresh the display.

**Benefits of Using a Controller**:

- **Separation of Concerns**: The controller isolates user interactions from the model and view.
- **Scalability**: As the application grows, the controller manages complex interactions.
- **Testability**: Controllers can be unit-tested independently.
